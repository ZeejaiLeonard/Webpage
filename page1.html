        <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
        <p>We'll have a super time. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Let your imagination be your guide. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. It's almost like something out of a fairytale book.</p>
        <p>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We'll do another happy little painting.</p>
        <p>Just make little strokes like that. Let your imagination be your guide. There comes a nice little fluffer. Just use the old one inch brush.</p>
        <p>Let's go up in here, and start having some fun This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.</p>
        <p>I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. We can fix anything. You gotta think like a tree. Let's have a nice tree right here.</p>
        <p>I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. You are only limited by your imagination. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away.</p>
        <p>This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Put it in, leave it alone. There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't hurt anyone. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart.</p>
